<br />Chat-Specific Rules<br /><br />No spamming or advertising other private servers, this includes LFG as well as anywhere in game.<br />No excessive cussing or flaming.<br />Do
NOT harass other players through whispers and the in game mail system.
If this is happening to you please take a screenshot so a gm can
address the issue.<br />Please don’t use colors in channels; we do not allow this because it may cause players to think you are a GM, etc.<br /><br />GMs<br /><br />When
requesting help from a GM we prefer you use tickets, this will assist
us in resolving your issue in a more proficient, timely manner.<br />Please
be patient once you have submitted your ticket, using the LFG channel
to call out for a gm is unacceptable. We will get to your ticket and
resolve your issue promptly, spamming will only get you kicked and we
don’t want that.<br />If you have a complaint with a GM, take it up with a higher level GM. <br />At times there will be things a GM is unable to resolve, please respect this and don’t push the issue further.<br />We
would prefer you did not ask us to port you places, if you’re showing
in a different instance please submit a ticket and we will get you into
the instance with your group.<br /><br />Reimbursements<br /><br />We do not reimburse gold under any circumstances.<br />We do not reimburse any skills, professions or items without a screenshot.<br />Screenshots

remember to screenshot your items often. <br /><br />Gameplay-Wise<br /><br />Botting, hacking, bugging or using any type of third-party application that doesn't record your screen is forbidden.<br />Raiding
other cities and killing NPCs IS allowed. Remember that killing lower
levels will get you no honor points. If you persist, you will get a
